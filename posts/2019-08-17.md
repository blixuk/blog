# Does the BSc Computer Security and Forensics course develop the skills required by employers in the area of penetration testing?

This was one of the first real assignments for my first year as Uni Studying Computer Security and Forensics. We has to first write our initial draft at 500 word and then the following week write our final at 1000 words. The draft was then peer reviewed by fellow classmates and feedback given to help improve the final assignment.

### Template notes

I make most of my notes in Markdown for ease and extendability. I find it to be a quick distraction free way of note taking that can be formatted later. I'm a big advocate for post processing of documents.

- What skills the BSc Security and Forensics course teaches
- What are potential employers of penetration testers looking for
- Does the BSc Security and Forensics course develop the skills required by employers in the area of penetration testing
- Conclusion or Summary

For this assignment I thought I would try something different and use R Markdown to write my whole assignment from start to finish. This seemed to be pretty straight forward, but I did run into a few requirement issues and formatting palarva.

# Introduction

## What is the purpose of this paper?

This paper is going to look at the BSc Computer Security and Forensics Course offered and presented by The University of Bedfordshire. It is going to compare the skills gained by graduates of this course to the skills required by employers. It will also look at the skills required for the roll of a Penetration Tester and if BSc Computer Security and Forensics Course offers those to a graduate; leaving university and looking for employment in the field of Penetration Testing.

\ 

## What is Penetration Testing?

@weidman2014 sums up penetration testing as the following;

> \small{\texttt{\emph{Penetration testing}, or \emph{pentesting} (not to be confused
with testing ballpoint or fountain pens), involves simulating
real attacks to assess the risk associated with
potential security breaches. On a pentest (as opposed
to a vulnerability assessment), the testers not only discover
vulnerabilities that could be used by attackers
but also exploit vulnerabilities, where possible, to
assess what attackers might gain after a successful
exploitation.}}

In essence penetration testing is finding security vulnerabilities in a system before any attackers can cause any actual harm. Most of theses vulnerabilities or exploits could be avoided just by keeping systems up to date and making sure employees have up to date security training.  

\setlength{\parindent}{2em}

There are many stages to pen testing and these vary on the job. Most start with the \emph{Pre-engagement}; 
Meeting the client and arranging the guidelines of the penetration test to take place. \emph{Information-gathering}; Finding all publicly available information on the client and using this information to discover a way to gain access into their system. \emph{Threat-modelling}; Checking the information gathered and the validity of that information to gaining access to the clients system. \emph{Vulnerability Analysis}; Searching for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. \emph{Exploitation}; Gaining access to the clients system using the vulnerabilities found. \emph{Post-exploitation}; Using the information gathered to gain deeper access to the system and other connected systems. \emph{Reporting}; Summarising all findings for the client and their technical team. 

## The Shortage of Well-qualified Graduates

@sullivan2018 said "Amongst the many cybersecurity positions companies are currently challenged to fill are penetration testers’ roles" He also goes on to say "However, the problem isn’t a lack of qualified candidates; the problem is how companies approach penetration testing". Research by @oltsik2017 suggests that 23% of organizations report having a shortage of pen testers, ranking penetration testing fourth on the list of cybersecurity skills where they suffer the largest shortage.  

@oltsik2017 goes on to say that 69% of organizations planned to increase cybersecurity spending in 2017, 39% of organizations say that increasing cybersecurity protection is one of their highest business
initiatives driving IT spending in 2017 and 32% of organizations say that strengthening cybersecurity tools and processes is one of their most important IT initiatives in 2017. 

This data shows that cybersecurity is a massive part of an organizations info-structure and their needs for security will only increase as more organizations move to cloud based operations. According to @oltsik2017 17% of New IT initiatives such as cloud computing, mobile computing, etc.
have been implemented without proper cybersecurity oversight and controls; causing the organization serious security events. 

# Skills gained on the BSc Computer Security and Forensics Course?

The BSc Computer Security and Forensics course offers according to [@cif2016]; A focus on network security, systems hardening, the process of gathering evidence and analysing captured data, and the legal requirements for those who work in the area. They also go on to say; The course has been designed to develop graduates who are able to: Exhibit an advanced understanding of methods, concepts and technologies within the core area of Computer Security such as Incident Response, Security Testing, Forensic Investigation, Wireless Networks amongst others.  

This course is split down into 12 units over 3 years. A student will complete 4 units each year, 2 units in the first semester and 2 units in the second. These units cover a range of topics from in the first year; Fundamentals of Computer Studies, Computer Systems Structures, Principles of Programming and Introduction to Software Development. With these units a student will build a foundation of skills and knowledge to be built upon in the second year. Learning; Networking, Operational Information Security Management, Security Testing, Forensic Investigation, Wireless Communications and networking.

# What are Potential Employers of Penetration Tesers Looking for in Graduates?

Employers are looking for well skilled potential employees, preferably with multiple qualifications in their desired field. Along with applicable work experience in industry. Employers are also looking for employees with a variety of soft skills: excellent spoken and written communication, creative thinking, industry and market knowledge, team working abilities, leadership qualities and problem solving. Employers are looking for potential employees with professional development; individuals who are looking to gain more knowledge and skills. Be that though further education or voluntary work with different sectors and industries in their field. 

In the field of penetration testing potential employers are looking for at least a relevant degree: computer science, cyber security, networking or forensic computing as a foundation with a few years experience in industry according to @penprofile2018. They will also be looking for potential employees with one or more certifications: GIAC Penetration Tester (GPEN), Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) or Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH). These qualifications can be gained on the job or though self study, this is a combination of personal development and gaining industry experience.

# Does the BSc Computer Security and Forensics Course Develop the Skills Required by Employers in the Area of Penetration Testing?

The BSc Security and Forensic course develops soft skills needed by employers and the relevant skills as an entry point into the field of penetration testing. But it does not give you the major skills to enter a position as a penetration tester as a graduate. A graduate will still have to employ personal development to gain the required certifications and qualifications, be that through further education or industry experience. 

The BSc Computer Security and Forensics course will allow a graduate doing a practice year to get ahead with industry experience, but over-all they will still have to gain the needed qualifications required by employers. They will have the advantage over graduates not doing a practice year. Having actual industry experience will allow them to gain more industry experience as they will require less hands on training compared to a graduate with no industry experience. They will also gain needed soft skills from working in an actual business environment.

# Conclusion

To conclude the BSc Computer Security and Forensics course offers more to a graduate taking a practice year than a graduate leaving and heading straight in to an industry position. This is more in experience and soft skills gained from working in a penetration testing position. A leaving graduate will have the applied skills, but will still need to build on self study and gain more certificates and experience.
